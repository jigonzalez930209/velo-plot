# 10 Million Points Challenge

Pushing the limits of web-based data visualization. This demo renders **10 million data points** in a single series, maintaining a smooth 60 FPS even during intensive interaction.

<div class="premium-demo-container">

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Points | 10,000,000 | ✅ 10M |
| FPS | 60 | ✅ Steady |
| Memory | < 100 MB | ✅ ~80 MB |
| Interaction | Zero Lag | ✅ Instant |

## How it's possible?

Velo Plot uses a highly optimized **WebGL pipeline** combined with intelligent **Level of Detail (LOD)** and **Hardware Acceleration**. 

1. **GPU Data Residency**: Data is uploaded once to the GPU.
2. **Fast Downsampling**: Our custom LTTB worker handles massive data processing without blocking the UI.
3. **Optimized Shaders**: Zoom and pan operations are handled entirely on the GPU.
